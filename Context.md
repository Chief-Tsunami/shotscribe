# Context

ShotScribe turns raw macOS screenshot filenames ("Screenshot 2026-08-11 at
3.41.07 PM.png") into dated, findable titles ("2026-08-11 1541 AWS Billing
Console.png") — on-device OCR (Apple Vision) plus a swappable Titler seam.

## Current state (as of 2026-08-12, v0.4.0)
- Swift package, four targets sharing `ShotScribeCore`: `shotscribe` (CLI),
  `shotscribe-mcp` (MCP server for Claude Code/Cowork), `shotscribe-menubar`
  (menu bar app), and the reusable core library itself.
- Default titler is `ClaudeTitler` — shells out to the user's own `claude -p`
  CLI (no API keys shipped, no account of ShotScribe's own). `KeywordTitler`
  is the offline fallback when Claude Code isn't installed.
- Menu bar app (`ShotScribe.app`) is packaged via `scripts/package-app.sh`,
  now Developer-ID signed, notarized, and stapled (app + DMG) — the first
  notarization run was clean (commit a5b221d).
- `skills/screenshot/SKILL.md` ships the `/screenshot` gesture for any
  Claude Code user, independent of whether ShotScribe's MCP server is
  registered.
- All four "doors" to the one engine (CLI, MCP, menu bar, `/screenshot`
  skill) are now shipped, per the latest commit message.

## Key decisions
- Only macOS default capture filenames get renamed — a file the user named
  themselves is never touched (safety rule baked into the core).
- OCR always stays on-device; only extracted text (never the image) reaches
  the titler, and only when Claude titling is enabled.

## Before touching anything
- Build: `swift build -c release`. Package the menu bar app with
  `./scripts/package-app.sh` (`APPLE_NOTARY_PROFILE=<profile>` for the full
  sign/notarize/staple pipeline).
- Tests live in `Tests/ShotScribeCoreTests/`.
- TODO: no CI workflow found in the repo — confirm whether tests run
  anywhere besides locally.
