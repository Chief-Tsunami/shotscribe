# History

Append-only session log. `/save` is the checkpoint gesture — new entries go
at the bottom. Seeded 2026-08-12 from `git log --oneline -15`.

## 2026-08-11 — Scaffold shotscribe
Extracted from the larger "Navi" app as its own single-purpose tool.
Core engine (`ShotScribeCore`) + CLI (`rename` / `label` / `watch`),
on-device Vision OCR, swappable `Titler` seam.

## 2026-08-11 — MCP server
Added `shotscribe-mcp`: the same engine exposed as MCP tools
(`latest_screenshots`, `ocr_screenshot`, `rename_screenshot`) so Claude
Code / Cowork can call it mid-session instead of shelling out to the CLI.

## 2026-08-12 — Menu bar app
Added `ShotScribe.app` (`MenuBarExtra`): auto-rename watch toggle,
configurable watch folder, Claude/offline titler switch, launch at login,
recent-rename history.

## 2026-08-12 — First-run polish
Icon, welcome window, folder choice, and login flow — passing the "I just
downloaded this" test for a stranger's first launch.

## 2026-08-12 — "Bring your own Claude" made explicit
UI and README now state plainly that ShotScribe drives the user's own
`claude` CLI/subscription — no keys, no account of its own.

## 2026-08-12 — Ship stage: sign, notarize, staple
`scripts/package-app.sh` gained the full Apple pipeline (Developer ID,
hardened runtime, secure timestamp, notarytool, staple) for both the app
and a drag-to-Applications DMG. First run was clean: both submissions
Accepted, `spctl` reports "source=Notarized Developer ID".

## 2026-08-12 — /screenshot skill
Shipped `skills/screenshot/SKILL.md`, a generic "see my newest screenshot"
gesture for any Claude Code user. Completes the fourth door to the engine
(CLI, MCP, menu bar, skill).
